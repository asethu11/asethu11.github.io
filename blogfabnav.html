            <h1 class="article-h1">NavBars: Why Aren't We All Swiping?</h1>
            
            <p>
            It is 2025 and I can't help but wonder why so many apps are still stuck in the past when it comes to navigation. It's been five years since Android transitioned to gesture-based navigation, and even longer since Apple made the move, yet we still see those old buttons and nav bars everywhere.
            <br>
            <br>
            This got me thinking...
            <br>
        </p>
            <h2><i>Why aren’t apps embracing gesture-based navigation?</i></h2>
            
            <br><br>
            <p>
            I was playing around with the idea while looking at FABs (Floating Action Buttons). 
            <br>
            Sure, FABs are cool and they offer a neat way to access features, but they always seem to require one extra tap, which is kinda annoying. But gesture controls? Why not let a simple swipe do the heavy lifting instead? Takes pretty much the same effort.</p>
        
            <h2 class="article-h2">The Past</h2>
            <p>
                Interestingly, <a href="https://www.nextpit.com/how-to-use-quick-ball-shortcut-xiaomi-hyperos">Xiaomi</a> experimented with a similar idea a decade ago. Check this out:

                <figure class="article-figure">
                    <img src="blogs/fab+nav/xiaomi-img.png" alt="Insert image" class="article-image">
                    <figcaption>Xiaomi's Quick Ball feature</figcaption>
                </figure>

                Their system was pretty close to Apple’s Assistive Touch (you could probably even call that a direct rip-off) but it offered a bit more customization. 

                <figure class="article-figure">
                    <img src="blogs/fab+nav/apple-img.jpg" alt="Insert image" class="article-image">
                    <figcaption>Apple's AssistiveTouch Feature</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="article-h2">The Present</h2>
            <p></p>
                Then there is this whole idea about how our eyes travel on a screen: <strong>The Gutenberg Principle.</strong>
            </p>
            <figure class="article-figure">
                <img src="blogs/fab+nav/gutenberg.png" alt="Insert image" class="article-image">
                <figcaption>Top left and bottom right are our natural go-tos, while top right and bottom left are less favored.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                <strong>Active and Passive Zones:</strong> Our gaze naturally moves from the top left to the bottom right. Those areas are prime real estate for catching our attention. Following this, most apps stick to the bottom for navigation as it would feel almost instinctive and free up the rest of the screen for what really matters. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h3><span class="red">So how's this a problem? Well, it's not. But it could be better.</span></h3>
            </p>

            <h3>What Makes Gesture Navigation So Tempting?</h3>
            <p>
                Here are big reasons why I think gestures could revolutionize our mobile experience:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>More Screen Real Estate:</strong> Without a clunky nav bar hogging space, your content gets to shine.
            </p>
            <figure class="article-figure">
                <video src="blogs/fab+nav/clicky-nav.mp4" class="article-video" autoplay loop muted></video>
                <figcaption>So much more screen real-estate</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Sure, youre about to say, “It takes an extra click”. But no, this is where the gesture comes in! Once the user understands where each nav-item is, a simple swipe towards that direction can do the trick.
            </p>

            <figure class="article-figure">
                <video src="blogs/fab+nav/gesture nav.mp4" class="article-video" autoplay loop muted></video>
                <figcaption>So much more screen real-estate</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <br><br>
            <p>
                And one more thing. Today’s nav bars are pretty strict with usually just 3 to 5 menu items. But mixing in gestures might just give us that extra space without sacrificing screen real estate, making everything feel smoother and more modern. And that brings me to my second point:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Scalability & Adaptability:</strong> A gesture-based system can easily grow with your app, adapting to new features without feeling cramped.
            </p>

            <figure class="article-figure">

            </div>
            <figure class="article-figure"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
            

            <h3>Why Gestures Matter</h3>
            <p>
                I see a future where this kind of natural interaction becomes the norm. Let’s break it down:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sleek and Minimalist:</strong> Removing visible buttons creates a cleaner look.</li>
                <li><strong>Speedy Interactions:</strong> Sometimes, a quick swipe is just faster than hunting for a feature hidden behind extra clicks.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="article-h2">The Future</h2>
            <p>
                Now don't get me wrong, I know there are some real challenges here. If we are to move toward a gesture-friendly world, it has to be done right.
            </p>

            <h3>Designing Gesture-Based NavBars:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Give Feedback:</strong> Make sure your users know their swipe was recognized. Haptic feedback with a subtle vibration, a smooth animation, or even a little sound can go a long way.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Gestures can be sneaky. A brief tutorial or some swipe indicators can help users learn the ropes.</li>
                <li><strong>Retain Click/Press Action:</strong> If the user is new, they could prefer to tap into the menu. This prevents them from being locked out of the feature while they’re still in their learning curve.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Consistent:</strong> No one likes a mixed-up gesture language.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Overdo It:</strong> Too many gestures can lead to confusion and accidental swipes. Keep it simple and focus on the essentials.</li>
            </ul>

            </figure>

            <h2 class="article-h2">Wrapping Up</h2>
            <p>
                I am not saying that every app should ditch buttons right away. But thinking back on early experiments, noticing our current limitations, and dreaming about the future makes it clear that gesture control has a lot of potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe this is applicable only to a few apps. But if it's different and usable, there’s a good chance it’s memorable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’d love to hear your thoughts but I haven't coded in a comments section for this website... So... uhm... catch you l8r.
