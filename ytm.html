            <p id="intro">
                YouTube Music has everything it needs to be a major player in the streaming world — a massive content library, Google’s backing, and a unique video integration. So why isn’t it taking off like <b><i>Spotify</i></b> or <b><i>Apple Music</i></b>? Users often describe YouTube Music as clunky, confusing, and frustrating.

                <p>
                    Since I couldn’t access Google’s internal data, I turned to what mattered most — <b>real user feedback</b>. I analyzed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blogs/articles about YouTube Music.</li>
                        <li>Dozens of Reddit threads where power users shared detailed feedback.</li>
                        <li>Play Store reviews</li>
                    </ul>
                    To uncover the real issues, I took a methodical approach to research — organizing my findings to identify patterns and prioritize solutions.

                <p>
                    I systematically <b></b>documented each pain point/user complaint</b> in FigJam, theming by comments like <b>“Navigation,” “Playlist Control,” and “Content Discovery.”</b>  This rigorous qualitative analysis ensured the insights were grounded in real user voices, not just personal hunches.<br><br>

                    Patterns quickly emerged around <b>navigation, personalization, and content access</b> – indicating the UX was the likely problem behind YouTube Music’s struggles, not the music catalog itself.

                <p>
                    After organizing my data, I analyzed the most recurring themes to identify patterns. This step was crucial. It helped me connect the dots and spot relationships between issues.

                        <li><strong>Content Hidden (Podcasts & More):</strong> YouTube Music isn’t just music – it has podcasts, liver-performances and music videos too – but some users barely knew it existed. Users admitted they resorted to the regular YouTube app or other services to find video-versions of songs, a clear sign of navigation failure.</li>

                    Samples was missing in the desktop version. In the Mobile version many ignored the Samples feature entirely, which means <b>a whole part of the intended user journey </b>(short-form discovery → finding a new song/artist) <b>was essentially broken.</b><br><br>
                    
                    This highlighted an opportunity to redesign the discovery experience to actually serve user needs (e.g., adding filters, better recommendations, clearer actions to save or play the song in full).

                    While the focus was on YouTube Music’s users, it’s worth noting many commenters spontaneously compared their experience to Spotify or Apple Music.

                    To see how YouTube Music performed against the two, I analyzed Spotify and Apple Music. I <b>explored their UI patterns, discovery tools, and content organization</b> to identify where YouTube Music was falling short:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spotify excels at discovery, with intuitive recommendations and smart browsing.</li>
                        <li>Apple Music offers a sleek, polished UI that feels effortless.</li>
                        <li>YouTube Music’s video library is a major strength, but it wasn’t being leveraged effectively.</li>
                    </ul>

                    The Redesign

                <p>
                    My redesign deals with just the desktop version — particularly those who listen to music while <b>working, studying, or gaming.</b> These users rely heavily on efficient navigation and seamless control, often <b>juggling multiple tabs or screens.</b> <br><br>

                <p>
                    To help users like Bella find podcasts easily, <b>the redesign adds "Podcasts" to the navigation</b>. This ensured podcasts were no longer buried and gave them proper visibility alongside music content.<br><br>

                    <b>It also signals to all users that YT Music is more than music.</b> (Insight tie-in: Users shouldn’t have to “hunt” for major content; this was a clear win from the research feedback.)

                    Many users felt <b>YouTube Music was missing the sense of “effortless discovery”</b> that Spotify offers. I realized that discovery <b>wasn’t just about better recommendations — it was also about better browsing.</b><br><br>

                    To improve this, I added a new feature: <b>Shared Sound</b><br><br>
                    For desktop users with less time to browse actively, these changes ensured that discovery felt intuitive and purposeful, not random.

                    ✅ Alex could now manage some playlist tasks a bit easier (not fully solved yet, but <b>navigation was clearer and less clutter helped focus on content</b>).<br><br>
                    ✅ Bella immediately noticed the <b>Podcasts button</b>, addressing her biggest pain.<br>

                    But some <b>deeper issues remained unaddressed</b> and a few new insights came up upon reflection and feedback from a couple of fellow UX designers I consulted. <br><br>

                    <h3>What Didn’t Work:</h3>
                    ❌ Despite the cleaner visuals, <b>some users still felt the layout was not ideal.</b><br><br>

                    ❌ <b>There wasn't much done for the customization aspect.</b> Users like Alex still would've been left frustrated.<br><br>

                    ❌ <b>The redesigned playbar didn’t work for the users</b> as it took up a lot of the space and didn’t add much value.

                    For the second iteration, I refined the design with a sharper focus on user feedback, but this time I took a <b>more experimental approach to solving the problems</b> I’d identified.

                    The catalogue items get a bit of a makeover to be more <b>distinguishable and easier to navigate.</b> This was a direct response to the feedback.<br><br>
                    A <b>huge competitive advantage of YouTube Music is access to the vast music video library</b>, but users weren’t fully appreciating it. They often stumbled into music videos when they only wanted audio, or vice versa. <b>The solution needed to balance flexibility with clarity.</b>

                    Improved Playbar with 'Studio Mode'

                <p>
                    I experimented a bit with the playbar, making it subtle again – but in way that it is more cohesive with the rest of the UI. 
                    
                    I have also made sure it is a scalable design. <b>The expand button opens up a 'Studio Mode'</b> which is a more immersive experience for the user.

                <p>
                    <b>The rationale was to serve both casual and power users:</b> in normal mode, the play bar remains minimalistic for quick control; but in Studio Mode, <b>enthusiasts (like Alex) can geek out on details</b> (perhaps see song credits or add trivia like with <a class="hyp-p" href="https://genius.com" target="_blank">Genius</a>) without cluttering the default view. <br><br>
                    

                    This wasn’t explicitly asked for by users, but it emerged from thinking about how to <b>exceed expectations while solving the core issues</b> (and it leveraged YouTube’s visual nature, aligning with the overall strategy).<br><br>
                    
                    This is a feature that could be a <b>premium feature</b> to add value to the subscription model.
