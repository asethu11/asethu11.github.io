                    <p>
                        In just 24 hours, we built MeetMate: an AI-powered meeting assistant designed to help PMs cut through the noise. From agenda prep to post-meeting follow-up, MeetMate streamlines every phase of the meeting lifecycle. I led UX and product design from start to finish, transforming pain points into a usable, intuitive solution under real-time pressure.

                    <h2>Meetings Are Broken</h2>
                    <p>PMs spend over 30-50% of their time in meetings but forget nearly half of what’s discussed. Existing tools cover only fragments—scheduling, transcription, or task tracking—forcing teams to juggle multiple platforms. This fragmentation creates confusion, reduces follow-through, and makes meetings feel unproductive.</p>

                    <h2>The Idea</h2>
                    <p>We set out to design an all-in-one AI assistant that supports PMs before, during, and after meetings. It had to reduce friction, simplify workflows, and eliminate the need to jump between apps. <br><br>

                    <p>As the only designer on the team, I joined immediately as the problem was scoped. While the backend explored AI integrations and the frontend reviewed existing repos, I focused on understanding user pain points quickly. We didn’t have time for interviews, so I turned to ChatGPT and Gemini to simulate real PM conversations and extract insights fast.</b></p>

                    <p>I identified recurring frustrations like last-minute agenda chaos, forgotten action items, and unstructured meeting flow. These issues informed the design priorities. I mapped out the full meeting lifecycle and used it to structure features across pre-, mid-, and post-meeting stages. This helped align the team and ensured that every feature served a purpose.<br>

                    I sketched low-fi flows and iterated rapidly in Figma, simplifying each screen for clarity and speed. The goal was to create an interface that could be built fast, understood instantly, and scaled later if needed.</p>

                    <p>Midway through, our frontend developer dropped out. To keep momentum, I quickly sourced a replacement through my network and began building a UI shell using Lovable and Replit. I ensured every screen was visually coherent and API-ready so we could integrate without bottlenecks.

                    <p>Once our new frontend dev joined (at hour 14), we hit the ground running. We co-built the prototype overnight. I stayed closely involved throughout integration, providing continuous UX feedback, tightening interaction flows, and refining layouts in real time. The result was a finished product that felt intuitive and complete—far beyond a typical hackathon demo.

                    <p>MeetMate is a smart meeting assistant that supports PMs throughout the meeting lifecycle. Before meetings, it suggests agendas, links relevant docs, surfaces unfinished tasks, and confirms attendees. During the session, it starts transcribing automatically and flags vague action items or unassigned tasks with subtle AI nudges. Afterward, it delivers clean summaries, highlights decisions, and syncs to task tools. It’s designed to feel ambient, not intrusive—minimal setup, maximum utility.

                        We used React and TailwindCSS for the frontend, FastAPI with Supabase and SQLite for the backend, and the OpenAI API for AI-driven features. Design and prototyping were handled in Figma, with live integration support through Lovable and Replit to keep development agile and collaborative.

                    <p>
                        We shipped a fully functional prototype in under 48 hours that addressed three core PM pain points—meeting prep, real-time focus, and post-meeting follow-up. Even with a mid-project team change, we maintained momentum and delivered a cohesive, intuitive experience. Judges were able to use the product without explanation, which confirmed the UX worked as intended.

                        <li>Good UX is as much about <strong>clarity and flow</strong> as it is about looks</li>
                        <li>The best tools are invisible—the user just <em>feels</em> in control</li>
